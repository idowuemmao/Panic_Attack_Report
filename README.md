# **Panic Attack Analysis Dashboard**

## **Overview**

Welcome to my **Panic Attack Analysis** project! This Power BI dashboard is designed to explore and analyze healthcare data related to panic attacks, with a focus on patient demographics, symptoms, lifestyle behaviors, and their correlations with panic attack frequency and severity. The project is built using **Power BI**, with data sourced from **Snowflake** â€” marking my first experience working with Snowflake as a data source.

This dashboard provides actionable insights for clinicians, healthcare professionals, and mental health experts by visualizing patterns in panic attack data, such as the impact of **sleep habits, alcohol consumption**, and **duration of panic episodes**.

## **Key Features**

* **Dynamic Reporting:** Interactive visuals using Power BI to display patient data based on parameters like age, gender, medical history, panic score, and more.
* **Snowflake Integration:** The data source for this project is **Snowflake**, which powers the backend data storage and querying, giving me hands-on experience working with cloud-based databases and scalable data solutions.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Measures like panic score, symptom prevalence, and lifestyle behavior trends are dynamically displayed, offering real-time insights to users.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard development.
* **Snowflake**: The data warehouse that stores and powers the data for this project.
* **DAX**: Data Analysis Expressions used to create dynamic measures and calculations in Power BI.
* **Power Query**: Used for data transformation and preparation within Power BI.

## **Project Structure**

This repository contains the following components:

* **Power BI Dashboard**: The main `.pbix` file, including all visuals, measures, and reports.
* **SQL Scripts**: Sample queries used to extract data from Snowflake (if applicable).
* **Data Model**: Description of the data model and relationships used in the Power BI report.

## **Learning Outcomes**

* **Snowflake Integration**: I gained valuable experience in connecting and querying data directly from Snowflake, enhancing my understanding of cloud data warehousing.
* **Advanced Data Modeling**: The project involved creating complex measures in DAX to provide insights based on user-selected parameters, such as panic frequency, symptom severity, and more.
* **Healthcare Data Analysis**: I applied data visualization principles to healthcare data, emphasizing the importance of actionable insights for improving mental health outcomes.

## **How to Use**

To explore the dashboard:

1. Open the **Panic Attack Analysis.pbix** file in Power BI.
2. Connect the Power BI report to the Snowflake data warehouse (if not already done).
3. Explore the interactive visuals and analyze the data for insights into panic attack trends.

## **Future Improvements**

* **Real-time Data Updates**: Integrate automatic data refresh with Snowflake for real-time insights.
* **Advanced Predictive Models**: Implement machine learning or statistical models to predict panic attack occurrences based on lifestyle behavior.
* **More Interactive Features**: Enhance user interaction with drill-throughs and customized slicers for deeper insights.
